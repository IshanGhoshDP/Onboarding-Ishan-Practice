## Task - 1  

# This task aims to familiarize with remote repository concepts by practicing Git commands such as `git clone`, `git remote`, and `git fetch`. The objective is to clone a remote repository, add a new remote, and fetch changes from it.

# Acceptance Criteria:

- Use `git clone` to clone the project repository from the main remote repository to your local machine.
- Verify that the cloned repository contains all project files and commit history.
- Add a new remote repository (e.g., a personal GitHub repository) as a second remote to the cloned repository using `git remote add`.
- Confirm the addition of the new remote by listing all remotes with `git remote -v`.
- Use `git fetch` to fetch changes from the new remote repository to the local repository.
- Ensure that the fetched changes are visible in the local repository, but do not merge them into the local branch.

## Task - 2

# Create a fork of the project repository and create a new branch named after the ticket number provided. The purpose of this task is to practice forking a repository and making changes in a new branch.

# Acceptance Criteria:

- Fork the project repository to your personal GitHub account.
- Create a new branch with the name provided in the ticket number format (e.g., `QA-32`).
- Add or update the README.md file in the forked repository.
- Document the usage and features of at least three components developed in the project.
- Ensure that the documentation includes clear instructions on how to use each component and any relevant code snippets or examples.
- Push the changes to the newly created branch in your forked repository.
- Create a pull request from the new branch to the main repository's master branch for review.
